# Learn Rxandroid
Learning RxJava and RxAndroid with simple examples.

To start with add the flowing to your gradle,

    //To make use of Java 8
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    
    //RxJava
    compile 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.0.6'

    //RxAndroid
    compile 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.0.1'

I am also beginner for RxJava and RxAndroid. I started with using Observables for doing some basic operations. Going further I will keep adding RxJava and RxAndroid related sample code. 

If any functionality sample code is needed or any suggestions please do mention. I would definitely try to put it here.
